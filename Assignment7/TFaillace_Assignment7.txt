The inode value of file1.txt and file2.txt are the same, they also have the same contents.

Once I edited the contents of file2.txt, file1.txt had the exact same changes.  The content of these two files are the same.

rm file1.txt
After this command, file2.txt still exists.

strace rm file2.txt

unlinkat(AT_FDCWD, "file2.txt", 0)      = 0
The unlinkat() system call is used to remove file2.txt

ln -s file3.txt file4.txt

ls -li file3.txt : 89921 -rw-r--r-- 1 faillace faillace 34 Dec  8 10:34 file3.txt
ls -li file4.txt : 89920 lrwxrwxrwx 1 faillace faillace 9 Dec  8 10:44 file4.txt -> file3.txt

The inodes differ for each file.
After editing file4.txt, the same edits are made to file3.txt.

rm file3.txt

After deleting file3.txt and then making an edit to file4.txt, file3.txt is recreated and has the same contents as file4.txt.
